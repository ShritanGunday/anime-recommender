A program that generates a list of ten recommended anime TV/Movie titles based on a MyAnimeList rated list.

This is a personal passion project of mine that can recommend anime to a user based on their MyAnimeList list (Note that the user needs at least
one completed, rated anime in order to use this program.

Users can use this program by first downloading their MyAnimeList anime list (Note that the file has to be in a .xml format). Next, run the program
within a Python compiler of your choice. Run the program, and input the directory of the file (You can also try to drag-and-drop the file into the input box).

This project may take some time to output your recommended anime TV/Movie titles, and for now this program pulls anime information from MyAnimeList.net,
however in the future I will change it to pull information from an unofficial API (such as Jikan V4). In the meantime, you may have to reload MyAnimeList.net
and keep verifying that you are not a robot so as to keep the program from stopping and allow it to keep pulling information from the website.
